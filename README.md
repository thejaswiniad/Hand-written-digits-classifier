# Hand-written-digits-classifier
A multi layer perceptron(MLP) neural network used to classify hand-written digits. By building a feedforward network with back propagation and training process using the Stochastic Gradient descent algorithm.
Without using any machine learning libraries.
Since it is a Multi-class classification problem- Implemented Softmax activation function for the output layer
Sigmoid activation function for the Hidden layers
